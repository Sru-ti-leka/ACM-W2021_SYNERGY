# PROBLEM STATEMENT CROP CARE SYSTEM

## Why ***Crop Care***?
- Agriculture is not a bed of roses many challenges are involved
- Challenges can be tackled efficiently with the integration of technology
- Expert guidance to help out the farmers is either inaccessible or non-existent in most cases.
- Hence our team finds this a crutial problem and needs solution.

## Features Planned
- NPK Monitoring and control
- Waterlevel/Humidity Monitoring and control
- Temperature Monitoring and control
- pH Monitoring and Control

## Plan Of Implementation

Internet of Things (IoT) is widely used in connecting devices and collecting data information. Internet of Things is used with IoT frameworks to handle and interact with data and information. 
- Estimation of nutrient is done using an NPK monitoring unit, and sent to micro-controller, NPK levels for different plants are prescribed in the program before. The fertilizer is then mixed with water stream and sent in.
- The water sending time is determined by the moisture sensor, that is in contact with the soil.If humidity is found low water sprayer or fogger is implemented
- Fan is rolled in if the temperature is found really high 
- pH is found and and if the pH is low pH high is initiated ans if it is high pH low is implemented
- All these sensors are connected through wi-fi using Node MCU and a relay controller.
